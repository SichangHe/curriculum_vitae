# Side Projects

## Happy projects

### Maintain & develop [mdBook-KaTeX][mdbook-katex] (2022/11 - )

mdBook-KaTeX is a preprocessor for [mdBook][mdBook] in the Rust programming
language.
It pre-renders LaTeX math expressions to HTML using KaTeX.

[![mdBook-KaTeX version][mdbook-katex_version]
![mdBook-KaTeX downloads][mdbook-katex_downloads]][crates_mdbook-katex]

- Took over [maintainership by publishing a fork][mdbook-katex2]
    when the project was unmaintained.
- Resolved more than 18 GitHub issues opened by others by fixing related bugs.
    For example:
    - Fixed persisting Markdown rendering bugs.
        For example, KaTeX outputs newline characters, [which broke Markdown
        rendering in tables and headers][katex-break-table].
        Fixed by replacing newline characters.
    - Fixed several error handling bugs.
        For example, fixed crashing on placeholder chapters.
    - Worked around Windows platform support issues from upstream.
        Provided a slightly compromised Windows build using an alternative
        dependency after coordinating with upstream `katex_rs` developers.
    - Fixed the GitHub CIs for MUSL Linux and Windows builds.
        Set up cross compilation to provide full-feature builds.
- Improved speed by over 10 times (on an M1 MacBook) by adopting parallelism and
    avoiding repeated rendering.
- Developed new features up to the point that mdBook-KaTeX is considered
    feature-complete. For example:
    - Adopted feature to preserve fenced code blocks according to CommonMark
        specification.
        Accomplished by hand-writing a finite-state machine to scan through
        Markdown code.
    - Added other features such as options to include math expressions source,
        enable MathML for accessibility, and use custom delimiters.
- Deprecated the problematic `static-css` feature gradually and provided an
    alternative.

### Author & maintain [recursive_scraper][recursive_scraper] (2022/06 - )

A web scraper in *Rust* that scrapes recursively, at constant frequency
(requests per time), asynchronously.

[![recursive_scraper version][scraper_version]
![recursive_scraper downloads][scraper_downloads]][crates_scraper]

- Learned from the design mistakes in [the SSO scraper][ra_search_engine] and
    chose elegant and maximally simple designs.
- Implemented without using mutexes or channels.
    Instead, used [`FuturesUnordered`][futures_unordered] to queue
    self-contained tasks.

### Other happy projects

- [Maintains and contributed to Open Source projects on
    GitHub][contribution_activity].
- [Configuration files][config].
    - Over 1000 lines of Lua for my modal editor Neovim and my tiling window
        manager Yabai.
    - Configuration for Fish shell, Starship, Alacritty, and Karabiner.
    - Support my smooth terminal and keyboard driven workflow.
- Learned new programming languages on [Exercism][exercism].
- Explored various operating systems.
    - Installed Windows 10 & 11,
        several Linux distributions such as Arch Linux, and FreeBSD,
        on hardware, on Parallels Desktop, and on QEMU/KVM.
    - Built a Hackintosh on a ThinkPad, but did not have Wi-Fi.
        Switched to QEMU/KVM instead.
- Explored various text editors such as IntelliJ and Doom Emacs.
    Daily drove Visual Studio Code before switching to Neovim.

## Failed projects

### Academic forum

I proposed to build [a generic academic forum for my Signature Work][prevSW].
I planed to build a web server that would good fit academic discussions such as
for discussions in classes.

- Carefully studied various web frameworks in Ruby, Rust, JavaScript, Python,
    and Elixir, and landed on Elixir Phoenix with Liveview.
- Studied Elixir and read [*Functional Web Development with Elixir, OTP, and
    Phoenix: Rethink the Modern Web App*][functional_web].

#### Reason I gave up on the academic forum

- I could not find a mentor at DKU with the proper expertise in the field.
- I found [Discourse][discourse], which has all the functionality I would build.
- I decided to focus on the other two projects: [FedCampus][fedcampus] and
    [`parse_rpsl_policy`][parse_rpsl_policy].

### Forum using Ruby on Rails (2022/06 - 2022/08)

[Forum][forum] using Ruby on Rails and Hotwire.

- Deployed it on Heroku.
- Developed features such as infinitely nested comments and MathJax support.

#### Reason for the failure of the Rails forum

I wanted to host this forum online as a community, as specified in
[the doctrine][doctrine], but I eventually decided that the benefits cannot
justify the trouble.

- The "magic" and debugging complexity of the Rails project grew quadratically
    as I added features by requiring more dependencies.
    I later switched to prefer Elixir Phoenix instead of Ruby on Rails.
- I did not find the environment to support the idea of a community forum.
    For example, when [the project participated in DKU Innovation
    Incubator][dii],
    the judges believed that it cannot survive without creating paywalls.
