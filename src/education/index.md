# Education

## Duke Kunshan University (DKU) (2020 - )

- Data Science major, Pseudo Computer Science major,
    Pseudo Applied Mathematics major.

    Note: Pseudo majors by completing major requirement courses.
- One semester at Duke University, Durham. Full grade.
- Started [my 30-thousand-word notes hosted on GitHub][notes] using
    [mdBook][mdbook] and [mdBook-KaTeX][mdbook-katex].
