# Education

## Duke Kunshan University (DKU) (2020 - )

- Data Science major, Pseudo Computer Science major,
    Pseudo Applied Mathematics major.

    Note: Pseudo majors by completing major requirement courses.
- One semester at Duke University, Durham. Full grade.
- Started [my 30-thousand-word notes hosted on GitHub][notes] using
    [mdBook][mdbook] and [mdBook-KaTeX][mdbook-katex].

### Significant courses at DKU

- COMPSCI 311—Computer Network Architecture:
    - Asynchronous [TCP server and client][CS311], in Elixir.
    - Asynchronous [CLI shell app][UDPRIP] using the actor model with channels,
        in Rust.
- STATS 401—Data Acquisition and Visualization:
    [Poster in D3.js & Svelte & TypeScript][STATS401_final_proj].
- COMPSCI 205—Computer Organization and Programming, at Duke:
    - Binary search tree in MIPS assembly and ring buffer in C.
    - Fifth place in PizzaCalc length optimization competition (68 lines).
- MATH 303—ODE and Dynamical Systems:
    - Read a review paper on differential equations with 99 references.
        Our group did poorly in the presentation talking about the paper.
    - Learned the necessity to start early in group works.
- COMPSCI 201—Introduction to Programming and Data Structures:
    - First CS class.

    [PageRank DKU website][STATS210_final_proj].
    - Scraped around 8000 webpages using Scrapy.
    - Calculated PageRank as a Markov chain using NumPy.
- Three entry courses for Physics, Chemistry, Biology:
    Learned the physical limitation to study natural science at DKU.
    Determined to study the quantitative reasoning division.
