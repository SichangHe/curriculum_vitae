# Education

## Duke Kunshan University (DKU) & Duke University Dual Degree (2020 - )

B.S. in Data Science (by DKU).

B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies (Data Science, by Duke).

- Pseudo majors: Computer Science & Applied Mathematics,
    by completing major requirement courses.
- Fall 2022 semester at Duke University, Durham. Full grade.
<!-- - Started writing [my 30-thousand-word notes hosted on GitHub][notes] in
    Markdown with LaTeX using [mdBook][mdbook] and [mdBook-KaTeX][mdbook-katex].
    -->

### Significant courses at DKU

- COMPSCI 311—Computer Network Architecture:
    - Asynchronous [TCP server and client][CS311], in Elixir.
    - Asynchronous [CLI shell app][UDPRIP] using the actor model with channels,
        in Rust.
- STATS 401—Data Acquisition and Visualization:
    [Poster using D3.js & Svelte & TypeScript][STATS401_final_proj].
- COMPSCI 205—Computer Organization and Programming, at Duke:
    - Binary search tree in MIPS assembly and ring buffer in C.
    - Fifth place in PizzaCalc length optimization competition (68 lines).
<!-- - MATH 303—ODE and Dynamical Systems:
    I learned from the major failure of our final group presentation.
    - Learned the importance of choosing approachable research starting points.
        We chose an intricate review paper on differential equations with 99
        references to reproduce.
        We struggled to understand the paper because it depends recursively on
        many other papers it references to.
    - Learned the necessity to start early in group works.
        My group members were occupied by other affairs and I made the mistake
        of waiting for them. -->
<!-- - COMPSCI 201—Introduction to Programming and Data Structures:
    - First CS class. Got interested in CS following
        [the Coursera course][coursera].
    - Presented about prime finding and sorting algorithms, flowchart,
        and debugger. -->
- STATS 201—Probability, Random Variables and Stochastic Processes:
    [PageRank DKU website as a Markov chain using Scrapy and
    Numpy][STATS210_final_proj].
    <!-- - Motivated to learn web development by weird problems in DKU website such
        as infinitely recursive URL links.
    - Decided to build my own web scraper because I was unsatisfied with Scrapy.
    -->
<!-- - Three entry courses for Physics, Chemistry, Biology:
    Learned the physical limitation to study natural science at DKU.
    Determined to study the quantitative reasoning division. -->
