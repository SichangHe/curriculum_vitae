# Education

## Duke Kunshan University (DKU) (2020 - )

- Data Science major, Pseudo Computer Science major,
    Pseudo Applied Mathematics major.
    Here, Pseudo majors are counted by completing major requirement courses
    because DKU is a Liberal Arts university.
- One semester at Duke University, Durham. Full grade.
- Started writing [my 30-thousand-word notes hosted on GitHub][notes] in
    Markdown with LaTeX using [mdBook][mdbook] and [mdBook-KaTeX][mdbook-katex].

### Significant courses at DKU

- COMPSCI 311—Computer Network Architecture:
    - Asynchronous [TCP server and client][CS311], in Elixir.
    - Asynchronous [CLI shell app][UDPRIP] using the actor model with channels,
        in Rust.
- STATS 401—Data Acquisition and Visualization:
    [Poster using D3.js & Svelte & TypeScript][STATS401_final_proj].
- COMPSCI 205—Computer Organization and Programming, at Duke:
    - Binary search tree in MIPS assembly and ring buffer in C.
    - Fifth place in PizzaCalc length optimization competition (68 lines).
- MATH 303—ODE and Dynamical Systems:
    - Read a review paper on differential equations with 99 references.
        Our group did poorly in the presentation talking about the paper.
    - Learned the necessity to start early in group works.
- COMPSCI 201—Introduction to Programming and Data Structures:
    - First CS class. Got interested in CS following
        [the Coursera course][coursera].
    - Presented about prime finding and sorting algorithms, flowchart,
        and debugger.
- STATS 201—Probability, Random Variables and Stochastic Processes:
    [PageRank DKU website as a Markov chain using Scrapy and
    Numpy][STATS210_final_proj].
    - Motivated to learn web development by weird problems in DKU website such
        as infinitely recursive URL links.
    - Decided to build my own web scraper because I was unsatisfied with Scrapy.
- Three entry courses for Physics, Chemistry, Biology:
    Learned the physical limitation to study natural science at DKU.
    Determined to study the quantitative reasoning division.

### DKU sports club (2020 -)

- Badminton club active member.
    - Acted as a judge for the game event held in Bacheng in 2021.
- Running Club active member for both the old Toads Running club and the new

    - Chose the routine for the 5km city-wide Park Run with Haibei Zhang.
- Cycling club and tennis club member.
