# Drafts

Dear Cloudflare Research Team,

I am a first-year CS PhD student working on measuring and
enhancing user-facing aspects of
the Web. When I met Vasileios at the Internet Measurement Conference last
November and shared my research on C2PA (Coalition for Content Provenance and
Authenticity), I was thrilled to
learn about Cloudflare joining this initiative to
combat deepfake challenges --- a perfect alignment with my research interests.

My journey with large-scale internet measurements began with RPSLyzer, where
I led the development of a tool analyzing hundreds of millions of
interdomain routes.
While processing this scale of data was exciting,
I know it's merely a glimpse of what's possible at Cloudflare.
Your unique position to transform research into planet-scale deployments, from
the Pangora reverse proxy to the recent one-click C2PA verification,
is precisely why I'm drawn to this internship.

What particularly excites me about Cloudflare is your commitment to
open collaboration with the research community.
Your willingness to share CDN-based passive measurement data and engage with
academic partners demonstrates a vision I deeply respect --- one where
research insights can directly benefit billions of end users.

As generative AI floods the Web with potential misinformation,
my current research focuses on understanding and mitigating its impact on
users.
C2PA presents a promising direction with numerous research opportunities, but
its success hinges on large-scale adoption.
Cloudflare's infrastructure and reach make it uniquely positioned to
turn this challenge into reality.

I look forward to contributing to Cloudflare's mission of
building a better Internet, particularly through the lens of
content authenticity and user trust.

I am a first-year PhD student in CS.
I have been researching the impact and response of users from genAI on the Web,
including the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).
Last November, I went to the Internet Measurement Conference to
present my paper, and to my surprise, learned I met Vasileios last November on
the Internet Measurement Conference, and told him about my research in C2PA.
To my surprise, he came back later with the news that
Cloudflare is joining this endeavor to protect end users from
deepfake images and other challenges brought by genAI, exactly aligning with
my research interests.

I have known Cloudflare and respected the large scale services you provide that
enhances the lives of billions of end users on the Web, and
your inspiring top-notch engineering.
From the Pangora reverse proxy to the recent one-click C2PA verification (TODO:
verify), Cloudflare has shown its unique position to
deploy what would otherwise only be research to practice, on planet scale.
In my previous project RPSLyzer with Dr. Italo Cunha, I implemented a tool to
hundreds oof millions of interdomain routes within hours, but
I know it would be a teaser compared to what we could achieve at Cloudflare.

I also respect Cloudflare for its openness to the research community.
Project like CDN-based passive measurement (TODO: and what)
are unthinkable with companies that secrete guard their data, but
Cloudflare published these continuously, with academic collaborators.

I started my PhD with the goal to measure and enhance the Web and
its user-facing aspects.
Prior, I lead the development of RPSLyzer, a tool to verifies if
obseerved interdomain routes match the routing policies those autonomous
systems declared in the Internet Routing Registry.
My previous research shed light into a corner of
interdomain routing management and security, but
now I am looking into directions closer to end users.
With generative AI advancing and flooding the Web,
the opportunity is clear that we must respond to the misinformation and
other risks before genAI gets out of hand.
So, I worked with my advisor and looked into problems genAI brings and
responses to them.
We see CPA as a promising direction with yet many uncertainties to sort out,
a great opportunity for research.
Most importantly, we agreed that
C2PA cannot achieve its mission without large scale adoption, which
Cloudflare is perfect for.

# Outline

- introduce yourself,
    how you learned about this internship opportunity through Vasileios, and
    that I believe it is a great fit for me.
- previous work: the RPSLyzer work you presented at IMC, where
    I met Vasileios. Only give a high level overview of the work.
    Emphasize how it inspired me to do a PhD and work on
    user-facing improvements of the Web.
    - your advisor and you believed that
        genAI would become a major challenge online, and
        C2PA is a promising direction, but I did extensive survey and
        found C2PA needs to mature in many aspects.
- Cloudflare comes in, it has scale, openness for research collaboration.
    Describe why the watermarking research is significant, interesting, and
    challenging.
- reinforce that you are fluent in Rust, and flexible and interdisciplinary.
