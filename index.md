Research Experience

Independent Researcher on Internet Route Verification Apr. 2023 –
present

Independent research, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil
(Remote) Supervisor: Dr. Italo Cunha

– Designed and implemented an efficient and comprehensive parser for the
Routing Policy Specification Language

(RPSL), a language used in the Internet Route Registry to document
public inter-domain routing policies, guide

public peering, and aid routing issue troubleshooting.

∗ Studied and complied with RPSL semantics in RFCs, covering over 99% of
all real-world RPSL use cases.

∗ Optimized the parser to generate detailed verification reports for
tens of millions of routes within an hour.

∗ Leveraged abstract algebra and Rust language features to guarantee
correct branching in report generation.

– Employed the RPSL parser to verify observed inter-domain routes;
analyzed verification reports and identified

common RPSL usage patterns and usage mistakes.

∗ Provided tooling to verify routes against the RPSL, helping improve
inter-domain routing security.

∗ Identified and implemented checks for 9 potential reasons why routes
fail to match the relevant RPSL.

∗ Conducted interactive data analysis in Rust with the Rust Evcxr REPL.

Research Assistant for Mobile Federated Learning (FL) Project Mar. 2023
– May. 2024

The FedCampus Team, EdgeIntelligence Lab, DKU Supervisor: Dr. Bing Luo

– Authored FedKit, open-source SDKs to streamline real-world FL
experiments across Android and iOS devices,

enabling training shared ML models collaboratively without sharing
private data on smartphones.

∗ Developed a pipeline to convert, train natively, and aggregate the
same ML models across Android and iOS.

∗ Implemented cross-platform continuous model delivery and training,
enabling iterative FL design in production.

∗ Contributed to the Flower FL framework: revamped the Android example;
helped correct the iOS example.

∗ Implemented on-device ML training with the experimental TensorFlow
Lite and the proprietary Core ML.

– Led and managed the systems development for the FedCampus Android/iOS
app, leveraging personal health data

from over 100 participants to conduct real-world FL and federated
analytics experiments on DKU campus.

∗ Supervised and mentored four undergrads and one M. Eng. student in
mobile and web development.

∗ Interviewed and recruited a UI programmer and a designer.

∗ Investigated and led core technology adoption, including Flower,
Kotlin, and Flutter, facilitating development.
