Research Experience

Research Assistant Aug. 2024 – present

Networked Systems Lab, USC Advisor: Dr. Harsha V. Madhyastha

– Thoroughly surveyed systems research problems stemming from
AI-generated text and images.

Independent Researcher on Internet Route Verification Apr. 2023 – May
2024

Independent research, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil
(Remote) Supervisor: Dr. Italo Cunha

– Designed and implemented an efficient and comprehensive parser for the
Routing Policy Specification Language

(RPSL), a language used in the Internet Route Registry to document
public interdomain routing policies, guide

public peering, and aid routing issue troubleshooting.

∗ Studied and complied with RPSL semantics in RFCs, covering over 99% of
all real-world RPSL use cases.

∗ Optimized the parser to interpret and verify hundreds of millions of
routes per hour.

– Employed the RPSL parser to verify observed interdomain routes;
analyzed verification reports and identified com-

mon RPSL usage patterns and usage mistakes.

∗ Provided tooling to verify routes against the RPSL, helping improve
interdomain routing security.

∗ Identified and implemented checks for 9 potential reasons why routes
fail to match the relevant RPSL.

Research Assistant for Mobile Federated Learning (FL) Project Mar. 2023
– May. 2024

The FedCampus Team, EdgeIntelligence Lab, DKU Supervisor: Dr. Bing Luo

– Authored FedKit, open-source SDKs to streamline real-world FL
experiments across Android and iOS devices,

enabling training shared ML models collaboratively without sharing
private data on smartphones.

∗ Contributed to the Flower FL framework: revamped the Android example;
helped correct the iOS example.

– Led and managed the systems development for the FedCampus Android/iOS
app, leveraging personal health data

from over 100 participants to conduct real-world FL and federated
analytics experiments on DKU campus.

∗ Supervised and mentored four undergrads and one M. Eng. student in
mobile and web development.

∗ Investigated and led core technology adoption, including Flower,
Kotlin, and Flutter, facilitating development.
