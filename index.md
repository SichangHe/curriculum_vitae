Research Experience

Research Assistant Aug. 2024 – present

Networked Systems Lab, USC Advisor: Dr. Harsha V. Madhyastha

– Surveyed usage, weakness, and extensions of the Coalition for Content
Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).

– Detect, understand, and respond to AI-generated contents on the Web,
their characteristics, cause, and effects.

Independent Researcher on Internet Route Verification Apr. 2023 – May
2024

Independent research, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Brazil
(Remote) Advisor: Dr. Italo Cunha

– Designed and implemented an efficient and comprehensive parser for the
Routing Policy Specification Language

(RPSL), a language used in the Internet Route Registry to document
public interdomain routing policies, guide

public peering, and aid routing issue troubleshooting.

∗ Studied and complied with RPSL semantics in RFCs, covering over 99% of
all real-world RPSL use cases.

∗ Optimized the parser to interpret and verify hundreds of millions of
routes per hour.

∗ Found RPSL usage varied widely among autonomous systems (ASes).

– Employed the RPSL parser to verify observed interdomain routes;
analyzed verification reports and identified com-

mon RPSL usage patterns and usage mistakes.

∗ Provided tooling to verify routes against the RPSL, helping improve
interdomain routing security.

∗ Identified and implemented checks for 6 major explanations to why
routes fail to match the relevant RPSL.

Research Assistant for Mobile Federated Learning (FL) Project Mar. 2023
– May. 2024

The FedCampus Team

, EdgeIntelligence Lab, DKU Advisor: Dr. Bing Luo

– Authored FedKit, open-source SDKs to streamline real-world FL
experiments across Android and iOS devices,

enabling training shared ML models collaboratively without sharing
private data on smartphones.

∗ Contributed to the Flower FL framework: revamped the Android example;
helped correct the iOS example.

– Led and managed the systems development for the FedCampus Android/iOS
app, leveraging personal health data

from over 100 participants to conduct real-world FL and federated
analytics experiments on DKU campus.

∗ Supervised and mentored four undergrads and one M. Eng. student in
mobile and web development.

∗ Investigated and led core technology adoption, including Flower,
Kotlin, and Flutter, facilitating development.

Research Assistant for Search Engine Research Project Dec. 2021 – May
2023

The Search So Team, DKU Advisor: Dr. Jiang Long

– Developed a feature-rich open source web scraper in async Rust to
scrape DKU sites, intranet, and Duke sites.

– Improved backend HTML processing, frontend interface, and version
control.
